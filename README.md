# Flowmeet Clerk Integration

This application was made to practice the clerk integration with an admin dashboard. This is a milestone in making my own video chatting platform with stream.

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/tanushchauhan/flowmeet.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd flowmeet
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Build the application

```bash
  npm run build
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm start
```

## What's next

Next I will integrate Stream into this and start working on the UI for the application further.
